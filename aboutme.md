subtitle: I take fashion advice from Kurt Martinson

My name is Ryan Sites. I consider myself passionate about all things devops and engineering. Orginally a Microsoft:registered: developer focused on the C# programming language. I am certainly not a Microsoft hater, and fully support their open source adoption over the past decade. However... I have found myself gravitating to functional and dynamic languages, and most recently been delving into the world of `Big Data` with Spark:tm: and Kubernetes:tm: with both Scala and Python!
